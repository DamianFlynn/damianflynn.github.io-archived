While doing some work with a customer earlier today, I referenced them to a post which I published last year and to my surprise they were unable to locate the post.

After some investigation, I am (not sure what emotion really) to realise that for the last number of months I have being publishing content to a repository which is not actually resolving publically.

So, this is just a short note, to:
* First, check I have the correct repo located which is public, 
* Second, Confirm that I will be sorting the issue out over the next few days
