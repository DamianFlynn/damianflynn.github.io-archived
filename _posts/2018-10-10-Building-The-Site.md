One of the unspoken truths behind the lack of posts in recent history, was due to a few bugs, which in the end resulted in an experience where from home it appeared that any new content was published and working; but outside this fortress in the real world, there was a large silence echoing.

I really only discovered this issue in May of this year, and was to say the least a little agitated with the situation, and decided then to change the approach to how I save my notes, and share my thoughts.

## Jekyll

After a lot of hours hacking at CSS and JS, neither of which are my strongest points; combined with a whole lot of *liquid* scripting, which is based on the Python Jinja library; I chose to leverage the open source Jekyll project.

This is not to say, that I might not reconsider this again as I am pretty intrigued also with Hugo; but one point is for sure... My days struggling with *Wordpress* are history. 

Don't get me wrong, Wordpress is great, even fantastic, but when it breaks, or its hacked (and boy have I been hacked), or when the comments system becomes a spam target; then its a total nightmare to have to deal with.

I want something that is easy use, a lot less prone to hacking, and easy to host; so my choice was clear form the start - I was going to use a Static Site generator
