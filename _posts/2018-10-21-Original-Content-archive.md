A quick snoop around this new site will expose a little hole which I am working on addressing in batches.

All the original content and images which were hosted on the previous incarnation of this site have been converted to markdown ready to republish. 

However, Prior to this happening, I have decided to update the taxonomy of the site, to recategorise and retag all the original content to fall into a more logical structure.

Expect to see all the original content reposted over before the end of the year, and if there is specific content you would need sooner, ping me on twitter!
