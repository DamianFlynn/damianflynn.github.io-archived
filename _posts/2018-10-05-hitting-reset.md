10 Years, Its hard to believe thats i have been posting thoughts here that long. And how so much has changed since I begun.

I started this journey with the encouragement of some amazing people in Microsoft, as an opportunity to spread the news about Hyper-V and even more relevant at the time System Center Virtual Machine Manager.

My daily experience with this application, Windows Server, and real world enterprise issues; positioned me at the leading edge of Microsoft Technologies; and a true business driver pushing forward. Exposing lots of fantastic information to share - sometimes not good news; but never the less - reality. Challenges to be faced head on, and an approach on how to address this.

I have primarily worked in the mindest that when I find an issue to be addressed, before sharing, escalating or attacking - I need to stop and consider solutions; which normally result in a more constructive and progressive approach to unblocking my path. That ethos spans back to my days working as what would be considered in 2018 as an IoT architect; in a rubber molding manufacturing plant; The Operations Manager always reminded me that I entered his office, If I dont have some suggestion for a solution before entering and presenting a problem - go away and come back when I am prepared.

I now realise that he had no technical knowledge, and without my suggestions, we were sunk!

## System Center Demise

While the solution itself continues to live on, as clear form the very recent launch of *System Center 2019*; my passion and engagement with this technology after working on a number of books, and speaking at so many events, ultimately diminished to a point of history.

## Personal Redevelopment

After almost 20 years I changed Jobs, A decision which was extremely difficult to make; and even post that break point; took at least 6 more months to adjust to the new order. 

I was now working with a team of like minded peers, and left to find a niche which I could own; working with some exciting cases; and totally new challanges was amazing; but yet I still felt empty. 

Just look at the number of blog posts I have published in the last 3 years

My personal life also took a major change; and today after celebrating 21 years of marriage; I am a super proud father of two amazing children, with the oldest just after celebrating her 4 birthday.

Combine these changes and its a totally different world from when I stood just 10 years ago.

## Finding the Mojo

Least week I participated in my first Microsoft Ignite event; and spent the vast majority of this opportunity meeting with so many old friends who have also evolved into completely new roles within their organizations.

As an example Taylor Brown; I had the honor of meeting almost 12 year ago, at which time we worked on Testing Scenarios for Hyper-V; in his role he ran the labs for Microsoft's internal testing; and I was responsible for our internal Technology Adoption Program (TAP) Pilot testing. Today Taylor owns the Docker (Container) features in Windows Server. An Amazing person, and achievement. 

There are so many amazing people, with just as amazing stories; and I was so proud to be able to stop, and say hello to these icons.

However, My Mojo has been getting some new life as I assume focus on taking my history and experiences, both technical, and political; and put these back to work. 

## Governance

As the adoption, and practices of Cloud become centrally focused for some many organizations the focus shifts left, as Compliance, Control, and Culture changes ignite to enable a completely fresh view of the potential.

When we combine this past experience, with the foundational tooling which 3rd parties like Terraform offer, and native tooling which is Microsoft adding to the core of their offerings, the next challenge is clear.

Now we have a path to assist organizations of any size to evolve from what might have been the chaos of Shadow IT, the central control of IT, or the old practices of Enterpries Architects; and guide them to a culture driven embracement of Cloud; supported with *Governance* and enabling that missing **trust** tought the use of *Safety Guard Rails*

## The next journey

Looking back at Ignite and the last 6 months; my Focus is in assisting organizations on this transformation. Focused discussions, lots of hands on demonstrations, Technical Policy's
