Damian is a Principal Consultant for [Innofactor](https://www.innofactor.com); an evangelist, Blogger, Lecturer and Public Speaker; Husband and proud father of two beautiful girls.

My career has been extended, and enjoyable, with a finger in computers and toe in electronics. Over the years I have accepted many accolades, but my favourites have included been honoured to be recognised as a Microsoft MVP since 2011 under the disciplines of 'Hyper-V' and 'Cloud and Datacenter', while also been a Cisco Champion since 2014. 

I am not the most prolific social media user, and freely admit a dislike to facebook *(and feel very vindicated as a result of the 'Cambridge Analytica' revelations)*. I do a little tweeting under the alias [@damian_flynn](https://twitter.com/damian_flynn), and frequent [Linked In](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/damianflynn) regularly.


## Biography

Over the last number of years, I have published some white papers and technical articles, a contributing author to [Petri.com](https://petri.com), hosting and participating in many webinars, and co-author of multiple Microsoft Cloud related books, and Official Courseware. However, my real passion is meeting and working with people, which I get to embrace as a regular presenter at many international and community events and conferences.
