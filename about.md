## Personal Information

I live with my wife, Breege, and our daughter in the West of Ireland. When I'm not working or spending time with my family, I'm enjoying model helicopters, planes and quads (drones), or if the weather is not kind, I can be buried working on home automation.

## Professional Information

I've been in the Information Technology field since 1993. Along the way I have worked as an engineer and administrator for multinational’s in manufacturing and services sectors dealing with large and complex IT infrastructures. My experience spans from digital data collection networks, Telco's and VoIP based technologies, I am currently specialising in Networking and Server Virtualisation and Containerisation (VMware ESX, Hyper-V, Docker), currently focused on Cloud Technologies in the Converged and Hybrid Datacentre, with perspective on Service Management Automation for repeatable processes in “Dev/Ops” scenarios, leveraging Software Defined Networks (SDN) and Microsoft's Azure Pack. Currently, I work as the "Corporate Infrastructure Architect" with Lionbridge Technologies based in Ireland, while also serving as a director for a Wireless ISP.

I have a keen interest in Cloud Computing from both a business strategy and technical viewpoint and have presented sessions on building and managing Private/Hybrid Clouds at a number of industry events. I am also honoured to be a *Microsoft MVP - System Center Cloud and Datacenter* since 2011, and a *Cisco Champion* since 2014, I can be found tweeting at @damian_flynn, and have published a number of white papers, technical articles and webinars; with my recurring motto of “Making incredible software incredibly simple.”

In addition, I am a former contributor to [Petri.com][1], a technology knowledgebase website with technical articles, how-to's, tips, and news.

I currently have four traditionally published books to my credit, the first two published by Wiley/Sybex, and the latter by Microsoft Press:
